== VGA

As you are probably aware, vga stands for video graphics array.
If however you are not familiar with the term, then your first computer
probably had an hdmi/vdi connector implying your are a young,
healthy and vibrant person... don't like you and hope lots of
icon:bugs show up in your code! Just joking, spread the icon:heart

=== CRT
What i recall from the inner workings of an old CRT monitor is not that
much, probably learned it sometime ago (15 years), it just did not stick.
In my imagination, which can be far from the truth, there is this photon
beam moving from left to right and just like the carriage return and
line feed, needs to to move back to the beginning and go to the next
line. Repeating this process until it has reached the last line of the
screen on which it moves the beam back to its initial state.
