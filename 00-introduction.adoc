== Introduction

For the last years the world of FPGA design has been calling me, and after fiddeling around with DE0-Nano I finally felt it was
time to dive into the deep.... 

Having spent most of my working career writing code that communicates with camera's, gps-systems, OpenGL, CUDA etc, getting 
contaminated with "designing your own hardware" bug is almost certain. Some of my colleagues have also been bitten, however diving
into such a new endavour is not always easy. One might fail... ;)
